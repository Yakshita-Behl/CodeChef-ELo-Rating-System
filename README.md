# CodeChef-ELo-Rating-System

This rating system is a method for rating participants in individual competitions, It is a modification of the ELO rating system, tailored for group contests.

A very basic idea of how the ELO system works is this: Whenever you participate in a contest, you compete in a duel with all other participating players. Based on your existing rating and the other participating players' rating, your probability of winning against each of them is calculated. Your actual performance is compared against this expected performance, and correspondingly, you gain or lose some points.

In this project, we try to extend this approach for multiplyaer games - here contests - and get user ratings based on performance and numerous other statistical formulae.
